def _get_time_difference(then):
    """
    Calculate the time difference between the input and the current time.

    Parameters
    ----------
    then : datetime time object
        The datetime of the time to calculate the difference from

    Returns
    -------
    dict of {
                'years': int,
                'days': int,
                'hours': int,
                'minutes': int,
                'seconds': int,
            }
        A dictionary containing the number of years, days, hours, minutes,
        and seconds that have elapsed between the input and the current
        time. The days, hours, minutes, and seconds are calculated as
        remainders from the immediate larger time interval. For example,
        the return would be something like 1 hour, 0 minutes, 0 seconds to
        denote that one hour has passed between the input and the current
        time. The dictionary does *not* return something like 1 hour, 60
        minutes, 3600 seconds (the interpretation that the dictionary
        contains the years, days, hours, etc representation of the time
        difference).
