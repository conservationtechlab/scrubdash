class AsyncioServer:
    """
    Asynchronous server that receives messages from ScrubCam and
    configures the environments (folders and files) used to persistently
    save ScrubCam session metadata.

    This class is used in conjunction with the HostSession class. Each
    HostSession instance represents an active connection to a ScrubCam and
    the HostSession instance is responsible for persistently saving data
    (images and lboxes) received from ScrubCam to the disk. Since a
    HostSession class is unable to read socket messages from ScrubCam, the
    AsyncioServer class is responsible for reading socket messages and
    relaying the messages to the correct HostSession instance.

    The AsyncioServer can also send messages to the dash server, but only
    does so to send configuration data like a HostSession's hostname,
    filter class list, and image log.
